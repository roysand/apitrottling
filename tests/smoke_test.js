/*
  Smoke test is a regular load test, configured for minimal load. 
  You want to run a smoke test as a sanity check every time you write a new script or modify an existing script.

  Run a smoke test to:
  - Verify that your test script doesn't have errors
  - Verify that your system doesn't throw any errors when under minimal load
